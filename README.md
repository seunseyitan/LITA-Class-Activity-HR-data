# LITA-Class-Activity
This is a project executed as class activity in Power BI during my data analysis learning period at LITA(Ladies in Tech Africa). 
This project contains employee data with focus on the attrition of the employees.  Attrition in this data refers to the employees who have left the organisation.
It aims at providing insights on rate of employees attrition in the organisation, causes of attrition, satisfaction of employees at the job roles, areas of improvement for the organisation to reduce attrition rate.
